## Project Idea
Automation Exercise is a demo **E-commerce platform** built specifically for automation testing. This project implements a full **end-to-end QA automation suite** using **Selenium WebDriver** and **Java**, divided into 4 key phases to ensure comprehensive test coverage of core user journeys, checkout, and system integrity.

## Work Plan

### Research & Analysis
* **Audience personas:** *Not Applicable for a QA project; focusing on **Test Scenarios** instead.* Test Scenarios cover user flows like **Registration**, **Login**, **Product Search**, and **Checkout**.

### Visual Identity
* **Logo design:** *Not Applicable.*

### Main Designs
* **Poster:** *Not Applicable; focusing on **Test Architecture** instead.* The project uses a **Modular Design** with a plan to refactor to a **Page Object Model (POM)**.

### Complementary Products
* The final deliverables include a **Well-structured Selenium test suite**, **Test case documentation (Excel/Markdown)**, and a **Bug and defect report with evidence**.

### Review & Finalization
This phase includes **Code Refactoring (POM)**, generating **Final Test Reports (e.g., TestNG, Allure)**, and preparing the **Final QA Report and Documentation**.

### Final Presentation
The team will provide a **QA Documentation and Project Summary** during the final presentation.
