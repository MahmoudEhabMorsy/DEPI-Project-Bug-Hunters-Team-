## Key Features  
- Complete E-commerce Workflow: Supports product browsing, category filtering, product search, cart management, checkout, and order confirmation.  
- User Authentication: Enables user registration, login, logout, and profile management for end-to-end user flow simulation.  
- Product Search & Filtering: Allows testing of search functionalities and product filtering by various criteria.  
- Contact Form: Provides a testable contact form for validating input fields, alerts, and submission behavior.  
- Order Placement: Simulates the full purchase lifecycle from cart to final order review and confirmation.  
- Automation-Ready Structure: Clean and consistent HTML element identifiers, ideal for developing robust Selenium-based test suites.
